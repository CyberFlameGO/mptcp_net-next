Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: use mptcp_addr_info in mptcp_out_options

This patch moved the mptcp_addr_info struct from protocol.h to mptcp.h,
added a new struct mptcp_addr_info member addr in struct mptcp_out_options,
and dropped the original addr, addr6, addr_id and port fields in it. Then
we can use opts->addr to get the adding address from PM directly using
mptcp_pm_add_addr_signal.

Since the port number became as a big-endian order now, use ntohs to
convert it before printing it out.
