Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: create listeners to receive MPJs

This change updates the "pm_nl_ctl" testing sample with a
"listen" option to bind a MPTCP listening socket to the
provided addr+port. This option is exercised in testing
subflow initiation scenarios in conjunction with userspace
path managers where the MPTCP application does not hold an
active listener to accept requests for new subflows.
