Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: use mptcp_addr_info in mptcp_options_received

This patch added a new struct mptcp_addr_info member addr in struct
mptcp_options_received, and dropped the original family, addr_id, addr,
addr6 and port fields in it. Then we can pass the parameter mp_opt.addr
directly to mptcp_pm_add_addr_received and mptcp_pm_add_addr_echoed.

Since the port number became as a big-endian order now, use ntohs to
convert it before printing it out.
