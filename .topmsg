Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add bpf_rr test

This patch adds the round-robin BPF MPTCP scheduler test. Use sysctl to
set net.mptcp.scheduler to use this sched. Add a veth net device to
simulate the multiple addresses case. Use 'ip mptcp endpoint' command to
add this new endpoint to PM netlink. Send data and check bytes_sent of
'ss' output after it to make sure the data has been sent on the new veth
net device.
