Subject: [PATCH] tcp: Prevent coalesce/collapse when skb has MPTCP extensions

The MPTCP extension data needs to be preserved as it passes through the TCP
stack. Make sure that these skbs are not appended to others during coalesce or
collapse, so the data remains associated with the payload of the given skb.
