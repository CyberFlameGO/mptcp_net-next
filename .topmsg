Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix checksum byte order

The MPTCP code typecasts the checksum value to u16 and
then convert it to big endian while storing the value into
the MPTCP option.

As a result, the wire encoding for little endian host is
wrong, and that causes interoperabilty interoperability
issues with other implementation or host with different endianness.

Address the issue writing in the packet the unmodified __sum16 value.

MPTCP checksum is disabled by default, interoperating with systems
with bad mptcp-level csum encodying should cause fallback to TCP.

Fixes: c5b39e26d003 ("mptcp: send out checksum for DSS")
Fixes: 390b95a5fb84 ("mptcp: receive checksum for DSS")
