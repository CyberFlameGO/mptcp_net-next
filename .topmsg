Subject: [PATCH] tcp_ipv6: set the drop_reason in the right place

Looks like the IPv6 version of the patch under Fixes was
a copy/paste of the IPv4 but hit the wrong spot.
It is tcp_v6_rcv() which uses drop_reason as a boolean, and
needs to be protected against reason == 0 before calling free.
tcp_v6_do_rcv() has a pretty straightforward flow.

Fixes: f8319dfd1b3b ("net: tcp: reset 'drop_reason' to NOT_SPCIFIED in tcp_v{4,6}_rcv()")
