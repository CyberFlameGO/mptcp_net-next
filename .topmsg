Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: capture netlink events

This change adds to self-testing support for the MPTCP netlink interface
by capturing various MPTCP netlink events (and all their metadata)
associated with connections, subflows and address announcements.
It is used in self-testing scripts that exercise MPTCP netlink commands
to precisely validate those operations by examining the dispatched
MPTCP netlink events in response to those commands.
