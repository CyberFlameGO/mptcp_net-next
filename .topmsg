Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: introduce implicit endpoints

In some edge scenarios, an MPTCP subflows can use a local address
mapped by a "implicit" endpoint created by the in-kernel path manager.

Such endpoints presence can be confusing, as it's creation is hard
to track and will prevent the later endpoint creation from the user-space
using the same address.

Define a new endpoint flag to mark implicit endpoints and allow the
user-space to replace implicit them with user-provided data at endpoint
creation time.
