Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: stop using the mptcp_has_another_subflow() helper

The mentioned helper requires the msk socket lock, and the
current callers don't own it nor can't acquire it, so the
access is racy.

All the current callers are really checking for infinite mapping
fallback, and the latter condition is explicitly tracked by
the relevant msk variable: we can safely remove the caller usage
- and the caller itself.

The issue is present since MP_FAIL implementation, but the
fix only applies since the infinite fallback support, ence the
somewhat unexpected fixes tag.
