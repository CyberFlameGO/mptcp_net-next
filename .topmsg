Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Do TCP fallback on early DSS checksum failure

RFC 8684 section 3.7 describes several opportunities for a MPTCP
connection to "fall back" to regular TCP early in the connection
process, before it has been confirmed that MPTCP options can be
successfully propagated on all SYN, SYN/ACK, and data packets. If a peer
acknowledges the first received data packet with a regular TCP header
(no MPTCP options), fallback is allowed.

If the recipient of that first data packet finds a MPTCP DSS checksum
error, this provides an opportunity to fail gracefully with a TCP
fallback rather than resetting the connection (as might happen if a
checksum failure were detected later).

This commit modifies the checksum failure code to attempt fallback on
the initial subflow of a MPTCP connection, only if it's a failure in the
first data mapping. In cases where the peer initiates the connection,
requests checksums, is the first to send data, and the peer is sending
incorrect checksums (see
https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/275), this allows
the connection to proceed as TCP rather than reset.
