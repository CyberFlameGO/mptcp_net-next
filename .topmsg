Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Make connection_list a real list of subflows

Use the MPTCP socket lock to mutually exclude shutdown and close
execution.

Since mptcp_close() is the only code path that removes entries from
conn_list, we can safely traverse the list while interrupting the RCU
critical section.
