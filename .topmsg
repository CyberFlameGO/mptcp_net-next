Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: interpret \n as a new line

In case of error, this message was printed:

  (...)
  # read: Resource temporarily unavailable
  #  client exit code 0, server 3
  # \nnetns ns1-0-BJlt5D socket stat for 10003:
  (...)

Obviously, the idea was to add a new line before the socket stat and not
print "\nnetns".

Fixes: 048d19d444be ("mptcp: add basic kselftest for mptcp")
