Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: improve 'fair usage on close' stability

The mentioned tests has to wait for a subflow creation failure.
The current code looks for TCP sockets in TW state and sometimes
misses the relevant event. Switch to a more stable check, looking
for the associated mib counter.
