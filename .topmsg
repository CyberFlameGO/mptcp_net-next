Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Remove redundant assignments in path manager init

A few members of the mptcp_pm_data struct were assigned to hard-coded
values in mptcp_pm_data_reset(), and then immediately changed in
mptcp_pm_nl_data_init().

Instead, flatten all the assignments in to mptcp_pm_data_reset().

v2: Resolve conflicts due to rename of mptcp_pm_data_reset()
v4: Resolve conflict in mptcp_pm_data_reset()
