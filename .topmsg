Subject: [PATCH] net: fix GSO for SG-enabled devices.

The commit dbd50f238dec ("net: move the hsize check to the else
block in skb_segment") introduced a data corruption for devices
supporting scatter-gatter segmentation.

The problem boils down to signed/unsigned comparison given
unexpected results: if signed 'hsize' is negative, will be considered
greter than a positive 'len', which is unsigned.

This commit addresses the issue explicitly casting len to signed
integer, so that the comparison gives the correct result.
