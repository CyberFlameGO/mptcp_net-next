Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add basic kselftest for mptcp

Add mpcp_connect tool:
xmit two files back and forth between two processes.
Wrapper script tests that data was transmitted without corruption.

The "-c" command line option for mptcp_connect.sh is there for debugging:

The script will use tcpdump to create one .pcap file per test case, named
according to the namespaces, protocols, and connect address in use.
For example, the first test case writes the capture to
ns1-ns1-MPTCP-MPTCP-10.0.1.1.pcap.

The stderr output from tcpdump is printed after the test completes to
show tcpdump's "packets dropped by kernel" information.

Also check that userspace can't create MPTCP sockets when mptcp.enabled
sysctl is off.

Will run automatically on "make kselftest".

This patch merged following enhancements:
From Mat Martineau: Add capture option
From Matthieu Baerts: Add sysctl test
From Paolo Abeni: Use tc/ethtool to test more skb handling code paths
