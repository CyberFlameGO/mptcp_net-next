Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: token: add mptcp prefixes to functions

some functions are removed as they only have one caller.
Functions that did not need to access the token tree are placed in
the compilation unit where they are needed.

Also adds error handling -- adding an object to the radix tree
might require dynamic memory allocation, so insertions can fail.
