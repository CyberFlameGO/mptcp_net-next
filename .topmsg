Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix subflow traversal at disconnect time

At disconnect time the MPTCP protocol traverse the subflows
list closing each of them. In some circumstances - MPJ subflow,
passive MPTCP socket, the latter operation can remove the
subflow from the list, invalidating the current iterator.

Address the issue using the safe list traversing helper
variant.
