Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: establish subflows from either end of connection

This change updates internal logic to permit subflows to be
established from either the client or server ends of MPTCP
connections. This symmetry and added flexibility may be
harnessed by PM implementations running on either end in
creating new subflows.

The essence of this change lies in not relying on the
"server_side" flag (which continues to be available if needed).
