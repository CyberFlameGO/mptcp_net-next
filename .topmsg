Subject: [PATCH] bpf:selftests: add MPTCP test base

This patch adds a base for MPTCP specific tests.

It is currently limited to the is_mptcp field in case of plain TCP
connection because there is no easy way to get the subflow sk from a msk
in userspace. This implies that we cannot lookup the sk_storage attached
to the subflow sk in the sockops program.
