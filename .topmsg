Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: never shrink offered window

As per RFC, the offered MPTCP-level window should never shrink.
While we currently track the right edge, we don't enforce the
above constraint on the wire.
Additionally, concurrent xmit on different subflows can end-up in
erroneous right edge update.
Address the above explicitly updating the announced window and
protecting the update with an additional atomic operation (sic)
