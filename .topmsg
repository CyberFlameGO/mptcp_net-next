Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: support MPTCP_PM_CMD_SUBFLOW_DESTROY

This change updates the "pm_nl_ctl" testing sample with a "dsf"
(destroy subflow) option to support the newly added netlink interface
command MPTCP_PM_CMD_SUBFLOW_DESTROY over the chosen MPTCP connection.

E.g. ./pm_nl_ctl dsf lip 10.0.2.1 lport 44567 rip 10.0.2.2 rport 56789
token 823274047
