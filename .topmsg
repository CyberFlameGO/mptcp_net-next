Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: shrink mptcp_out_options struct

After the previous patch we can alias with a union several
fields in mptcp_out_options. Such struct is stack allocated and
memset() for each plain TCP out packet. Every saved byted counts.

Before:
pahole -EC mptcp_out_options
 # ...
/* size: 136, cachelines: 3, members: 17 */

After:
pahole -EC mptcp_out_options
 # ...
/* size: 56, cachelines: 1, members: 9 */
