Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: drop SK_RECLAIM_* macros

After commit 4890b686f408 ("net: keep sk->sk_forward_alloc as small as
possible"), the MPTCP protocol is the last SK_RECLAIM_CHUNK and
SK_RECLAIM_THRESHOLD users.

Update the MPTCP reclaim schema to match the core/TCP one and drop the
mentioned macros. This additionally clean the MPTCP code a bit.
