Subject: [PATCH] perf: ignore deprecation warning when using libbpf's btf__get_from_id()

Perf code re-implements libbpf's btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() API as
a weak function, presumably to dynamically link against old version of
libbpf shared library. Unfortunately this causes compilation warning
when perf is compiled against libbpf v0.6+.

For now, just ignore deprecation warning, but there might be a better
solution, depending on perf's needs.
