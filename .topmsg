Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: schedule worker when subflow is closed

When remote side closes a subflow we should schedule the worker to
dispose of the subflow in a timely manner.

Otherwise, SF_CLOSED event won't be generated until the mptcp
socket itself is closing or local side is closing another subflow.
