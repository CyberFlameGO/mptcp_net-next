Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: support MPTCP_PM_CMD_ANNOUNCE

This change updates the "pm_nl_ctl" testing sample with an "ann"
(announce) option to support the newly added netlink interface command
MPTCP_PM_CMD_ANNOUNCE to issue ADD_ADDR advertisements over the
chosen MPTCP connection.

E.g. ./pm_nl_ctl ann 192.168.122.75 token 823274047 id 25 dev enp1s0
