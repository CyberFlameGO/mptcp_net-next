Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix 'dubious one-bit signed bitfield' warnings

Our CI[1] reported these warnings when using Sparse:

  $ touch net/mptcp/bpf.c
  $ make C=1 net/mptcp/bpf.o
  net/mptcp/bpf.c: note: in included file:
  include/linux/bpf_verifier.h:348:26: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
  include/linux/bpf_verifier.h:349:29: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield

Set them as 'unsigned' to avoid warnings.
