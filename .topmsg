Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add set_flags tests in pm_netlink.sh

This patch added the setting flags test cases, using both addr-based and
id-based lookups for the setting address.

The output looks like this:

 set flags (backup)                                 [ OK ]
           (nobackup)                               [ OK ]
           (fullmesh)                               [ OK ]
           (nofullmesh)                             [ OK ]
           (backup,fullmesh)                        [ OK ]
