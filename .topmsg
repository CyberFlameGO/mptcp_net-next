Subject: [PATCH] tcp: Prevent coalesce/collapse when skb has MPTCP extensions

The MPTCP extension data needs to be preserved as it passes through the
TCP stack. Make sure that these skbs are not appended to others during
coalesce or collapse, so the data remains associated with the payload of
the given skb.
