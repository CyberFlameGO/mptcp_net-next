Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: drop all sub-options except ADD_ADDR when the echo bit is set

Current Linux carries echo-ed ADD_ADDR over pure TCP ACKs, so there is no
need to add a DSS element that would fit only ADD_ADDR with IPv4 address.
Drop the DSS from echo-ed ADD_ADDR, regardless of the IP version.
