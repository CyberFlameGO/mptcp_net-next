Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: selftests: Add capture option

Added a "-c" command line option for mptcp_connect.sh to make it easier
to capture packets from each test. The script will use tcpdump to create
one .pcap file per test case, named according to the namespaces,
protocols, and connect address in use. For example, the first test case
writes the capture to ns1-ns1-MPTCP-MPTCP-10.0.1.1.pcap

The stderr output from tcpdump is printed after the test completes to
show tcpdump's "packets dropped by kernel" information.
