Subject: [PATCH] tcp: allow MPTCP to update the announced window

The MPTCP RFC requires that the MPTCP-level receive window's
right edge never moves backward. Currently the MPTCP code
enforces such constraint while tracking the right edge, but it
does not reflects it on the wire, as MPTCP lacks a suitable hook
to update accordingly the TCP header.

This change modifies the existing mptcp_write_options() hook,
providing the current packet's TCP header to the MPTCP protocol,
so that the next patch could implement the above mentioned
constraint.

No functional changes intended.
