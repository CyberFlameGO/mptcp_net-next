Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Add path manager interface

Add enough of a path manager interface to allow sending of ADD_ADDR
when an incoming MPTCP connection is created. Capable of sending only
a single IPv4 ADD_ADDR option. The 'pm_data' element of the connection
sock will need to be expanded to handle multiple interfaces and IPv6.

This is a skeleton interface definition for events generated by
MPTCP.
