Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add set_flags command in pm_nl_ctl

This patch added the set_flags command in pm_nl_ctl, currently we can only
set two flags: backup and nobackup. The set_flags command can be used like
this:

 # pm_nl_ctl set 10.0.0.1 flags backup
 # pm_nl_ctl set 10.0.0.1 flags nobackup
