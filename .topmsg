Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: read attributes of addr entries managed by userspace PMs

This change introduces a parallel path in the kernel for retrieving
the local id, flags, if_index for an addr entry in the context of
an MPTCP connection that's being managed by a userspace PM. The
userspace and in-kernel PM modes deviate in their procedures for
obtaining this information.
