Subject: [PATCH] selftest: add mmap-write support

No changes on default options.  New option -b allows to set a lower
send buffer size.

New option "-m mmap" allows to use a mode where the sender transmits the
entire file in very large chunks (using mmap + write) instead of the
default poll+read/write.

This is mainly useful to make sure we cope with large writes.
I also added sendfile() support (as its easy), but it won't work yet
for mptcp sockets.

should be squashed into mptcp: add basic kselftest for mptcp
