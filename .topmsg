Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Add struct mptcp_sock definition when CONFIG_MPTCP is disabled

The btf_sock_ids array needs struct mptcp_sock BTF ID for
the bpf_skc_to_mptcp_sock helper.

When CONFIG_MPTCP is disabled, the 'struct mptcp_sock' is not
defined and resolve_btfids will complain with:

  BTFIDS  vmlinux
WARN: resolve_btfids: unresolved symbol mptcp_sock

Adding empty difinition for struct mptcp_sock when CONFIG_MPTCP
is disabled.
