Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add more arguments for chk_join_nr

This patch added five more arguments for chk_join_nr(). The default
values of them are all zero.

The first two, csum_ns1 and csum_ns1, are passed to chk_csum_nr(), to
check the mib counters of the checksum errors in ns1 and ns2. A '+'
can be added into this two arguments to represent that multiple
checksum errors are allowed when doing this check. For example,

        chk_csum_nr "" +2 +2

indicates that two or more checksum errors are allowed in both ns1 and
ns2.

The remaining three, fail_nr, rst_nr and infi_nr, are passed to
chk_fail_nr(), chk_rst_nr() and chk_infi_nr() respectively, to check
the sending and receiving mib counters of MP_FAIL, MP_RST and the
infinite map.

Also did some cleanups in chk_fail_nr(), renamed two local variables
and updated the output message.
