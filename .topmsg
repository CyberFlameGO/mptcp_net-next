Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: optimize release_cb for the common case

The mptcp release callback checks several flags in atomic
context, but only MPTCP_CLEAN_UNA can be up frequently.

Reorganize the code to avoid multiple conditionals in the
most common scenarios.

Additional clarify a related comment.
