Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: really share subflow snd_wnd

As per RFC, mptcp subflows use a "shared" snd_wnd: the effective
window is the maximum among the current values received on all
subflows. Without such feature a data transfer using multiple
subflows could block.

Window sharing is currently implemented in the RX side:
__tcp_select_window uses the mptcp-level receive buffer to compute
the announced window.

That is not enough: the TCP stack will stick to the window size
received on the given subflow; we need to propagate the msk window
value on each subflow at xmit time.

Change the packet scheduler to ignore the subflow level window
and use instead the msk level one
