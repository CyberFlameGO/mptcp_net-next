Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: address lookup improvements

When looking-up a socket address in the endpoint list, we
must prefer port-based matches over address only match.

Ensure that port-based endpoints are listed first, using
head insertion for them. Additionally be sure that only
port-based endpoints carry a non zero port number.
