Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: introduce and use mptcp_pm_send_ack()

The in-kernel PM has a bit of duplicate code related to ack
generation. Create a new helper factoring out the PM-specific
needs and use it in a couple of places.

As a bonus, mptcp_subflow_send_ack() is not used anymore
outside its own compilation unit and can become static.
