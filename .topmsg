Subject: [PATCH] bpf: add 'bpf_mptcp_sock' structure and helper

In order to precisely identify the parent MPTCP connection of a subflow,
it is required to access the mptcp_sock's token which uniquely identify a
MPTCP connection.

This patch adds a new structure 'bpf_mptcp_sock' exposing the 'token' field
of the 'mptcp_sock' extracted from a subflow's 'tcp_sock'. It also adds the
declaration of a new BPF helper of the same name to expose the newly
defined structure in the userspace BPF API.

This is the foundation to expose more MPTCP-specific fields through BPF.

Currently, it is limited to the field 'token' of the msk but it is
easily extensible.
