Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: clarify when options can be used

RFC8684 doesn't seem to clearly specify which MPTCP options can be used
together.

Some options are mutually exclusive -- e.g. MP_CAPABLE and MP_JOIN --,
some can be used together -- e.g. DSS + MP_PRIO --, some can but we
prefer not to -- e.g. DSS + ADD_ADDR -- and some have to be used
together at some points -- e.g. MP_FAIL and DSS.

We need to clarify this as a base before allowing other modifications.

For example, does it make sense to send a RM_ADDR with an MPC or MPJ?
This remains open for possible future discussions.
