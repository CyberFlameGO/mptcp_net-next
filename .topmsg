Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add bpf_bkup test

This patch adds the backup BPF MPTCP scheduler test. Use sysctl to
set net.mptcp.scheduler to use this sched. Add a veth net device to
simulate the multiple addresses case. Use 'ip mptcp endpoint' command
to add this new endpoint to PM netlink with backup flag. Send data,
check bytes_sent of 'ss' output, and do some cleanups.
