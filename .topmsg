Subject: [PATCH] copy connection id from first subflow to mptcp socket

This allows to call inet(6)_getname on the parent socket
and it will return the right result.

At this time it only works because the first incoming subflow has a
'struct socket' allocated.

This will change in followup patch, passive subflows will not have
a socket struct anymore.
