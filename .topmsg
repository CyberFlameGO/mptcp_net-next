Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: avoid backquotes

As explained on ShellCheck's wiki [1], it is recommended to avoid
backquotes `...` in favour of parenthesis $(...):

> Backtick command substitution `...` is legacy syntax with several
> issues.
>
> - It has a series of undefined behaviors related to quoting in POSIX.
> - It imposes a custom escaping mode with surprising results.
> - It's exceptionally hard to nest.
>
> $(...) command substitution has none of these problems, and is
> therefore strongly encouraged.
