Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix conflict with <netinet/in.h>

Including <linux/mptcp.h> before the C library <netinet/in.h> header
causes symbol redefinition errors at compile-time due to duplicate
declarations and definitions in the <linux/in.h> header included by
<linux/mptcp.h>.

Explicitly include <netinet/in.h> before <linux/in.h> in
<linux/mptcp.h> when __KERNEL__ is not defined so that the C library
compatibility logic in <linux/libc-compat.h> is enabled when including
<linux/mptcp.h> in user space code.
