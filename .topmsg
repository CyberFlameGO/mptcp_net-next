Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix locking in mptcp_nl_cmd_sf_destroy()

The user-space PM subflow removal path uses a couple of helpers
that must be called under the msk socket lock and the current
code lacks such requirement.

Change the existing lock scope so that the relevant code is under
its protection.
