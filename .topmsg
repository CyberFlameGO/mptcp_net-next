Subject: [PATCH] DO-NOT-MERGE: git markup: fixes other trees

All commits older than this one are fixes from/for other trees than the
net ones: -net and net-next.

Typically they are fixing issues blocking our tests.

Following commits are fixes for the -net tree.

This commit is useful to easily find where are the fixes from/for other
trees.
