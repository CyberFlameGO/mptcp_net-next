Subject: [PATCH] tcp, ulp: Add clone operation to tcp_ulp_ops

If ULP is used on a listening socket, icsk_ulp_ops and icsk_ulp_data are
copied when the listener is cloned. Sometimes the clone is immediately
deleted, which will invoke the release op on the clone and likely
corrupt the listening socket's icsk_ulp_data.

The clone operation is invoked immediately after the clone is copied and
gives the ULP type an opportunity to set up the clone socket and its
icsk_ulp_data.
