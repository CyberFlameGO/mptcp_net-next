Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: make sure timer is inited once data is pending for transmission

The mptcp_connect self-tests with additional '-m mmap' argument triggers a
(harmless) WARN_ON_ONCE splat in mptcp_reset_timer() as the msk sockets
timer_ival is still 0.

This is because the timer is only set up after the transmit loop, but
the splat can be triggered once the first mptcp-level ACK is processed.
