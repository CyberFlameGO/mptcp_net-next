Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: Initialize variables to quiet gcc 12 warnings

In a few MPTCP selftest tools, gcc 12 complains that the 'sock' variable
might be used uninitialized. This is a false positive because the only
code path that could lead to uninitialized access is where getaddrinfo()
fails, but the local xgetaddrinfo() wrapper exits if such a failure
occurs.

Initialize the 'sock' variable anyway to allow the tools to build with
gcc 12.
