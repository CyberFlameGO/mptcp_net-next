Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: send ADD_ADDR echo before create subflows

In some corner cases, the peer handing an incoming ADD_ADDR option, can
receive a retransmitted ADD_ADDR for the same address before the subflow
creation completes.

We can avoid the above issue by generating and sending the ADD_ADDR echo
before starting the MPJ subflow connection.

This slightly changes the behaviour of the packetdrill tests as the
ADD_ADDR echo packet is sent earlier.
