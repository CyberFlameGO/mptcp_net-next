Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: never allow the PM to close a listener subflow

Currently, when deleting an endpoint the netlink PM treverses
all the local MPTCP sockets, regardless of their status.

If an MPTCP listener socket is bound to the IP matching the
delete endpoint, the listener TCP socket will be closed.
That is unexpected, the PM should only affect data subflows.

Fix the issue explicitly skipping MPTCP socket in TCP_LISTEN
status.
