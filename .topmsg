Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: act_pedit: really ensure the skb is writable

Currently pedit tries to ensure that the accessed skb offset
is writeble via skb_unclone(). The action potentially allows
touching any skb bytes, so it may end-up modifying shared data.

The above causes some sporadic MPTCP self-test failures.

Address the issue keeping track of a rough over-estimate highest skb
offset accessed by the action and ensure such offset is really
writable.

Note that this may cause performance regressions in some scenario,
but hopefully pedit is not critical path.
