Subject: [PATCH] Partially revert "tcp: factor out tcp_build_frag()"

This is a partial revert for commit b796d04bd014 ("tcp:
factor out tcp_build_frag()").

MPTCP was the only user of the tcp_build_frag helper, and after
the previous patch MPTCP does not use the mentioned helper anymore.
Let's avoid exposing TCP internals.

The revert is partial, as tcp_remove_empty_skb(), exposed
by the same commit is still required.
