Subject: [PATCH] bpf: fix 'dubious one-bit signed bitfield' warnings

Our CI[1] reported these warnings when using Sparse:

  $ touch net/mptcp/bpf.c
  $ make C=1 net/mptcp/bpf.o
  net/mptcp/bpf.c: note: in included file:
  include/linux/bpf_verifier.h:348:26: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
  include/linux/bpf_verifier.h:349:29: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield

These two fields from the new 'bpf_loop_inline_state' structure are used
as booleans. Instead of declaring two 'unsigned int', we can declare
them as 'bool'.

While at it, also set 'state->initialized' to 'true' instead of '1' to
make it clearer it is linked to a 'bool' type.
