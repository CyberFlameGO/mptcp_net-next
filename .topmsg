Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: mark ops structures as ro_after_init

These structures are initialised from the init hooks, so we can't make
them 'const'.  But no writes occur afterwards, so we can use ro_after_init.

Also, remove bogus EXPORT_SYMBOL, the only access comes from ip
stack, not from kernel modules.
