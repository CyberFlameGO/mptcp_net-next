Subject: [PATCH] mptcp:sendmsg: truncate source buffer if mptcp sndbuf size was set from userspace

If userspace uses SO_SNDBUF to set a value, then truncate the buffer
according to remaining wmem.

Otherwise, running selftest script with "-m mmap -b 4096" shows very
large sucessful write() calls, as we're only limited by how much data
the underlying tcp flow is willing to accept.

NB: It might make sense to carry SO_SNDBUF down to the subflows,
but thats left out for now.
