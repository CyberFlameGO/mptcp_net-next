Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: launch mptcp_connect with timeout

'mptcp_connect' already has a timeout for poll() but in some cases, it
is not enough.

With "timeout" tool, we will force the command to fail if it doesn't
finish on time. Thanks to that, the script will continue and display
details about the current state before marking the test as failed.
Displaying this state is very important to be able to understand the
issue. Best to have our CI reporting the issue than just "the test
hanged".

Note that in mptcp_connect.sh, we were using a long timeout to validate
the fact we cannot create a socket if a sysctl is set. We don't need
this timeout.
