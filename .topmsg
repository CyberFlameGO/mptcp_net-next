Subject: [PATCH] module: kunit: Load .kunit_test_suites section when CONFIG_KUNIT=m

The new KUnit module handling has KUnit test suites listed in a
.kunit_test_suites section of each module. This should be loaded when
the module is, but at the moment this only happens if KUnit is built-in.

Also load this when KUnit is enabled as a module: it'll not be usable
unless KUnit is loaded, but such modules are likely to depend on KUnit
anyway, so it's unlikely to ever be loaded needlessly.
