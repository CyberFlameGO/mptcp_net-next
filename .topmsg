Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: netlink: split mptcp_pm_parse_addr into two functions

Next patch will need to parse MPTCP_PM_ATTR_ADDR attributes and
fill an mptcp_addr_info structure from a different genl command
callback.

To avoid copy-paste, split the existing function to a helper
that does the common part and then call the helper from the
(renamed)mptcp_pm_parse_entry function.
